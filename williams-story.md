William was born and raised in the island city of Singapore. Like his brothers before him, he was an <a title="Anglo-Chinese School" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_School" target="_blank">ACS</a> boy (ACS (J) ‘00, ACS (I) ‘04).  After graduation from ACS, he went onto [CJC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Junior_College "Catholic Junior College") and was proud to be part of the school “soccer” (ahem, rugby) team.

After finishing up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore" target="_blank">National Service</a>, William went to college in the United States at the University of Southern California, eventually graduating college in 3 years with Cum Laude honors in 2012!  William was on track to finish his MSc in Business Taxation and also received an offer from KPMG to start as a Tax Associate for Fall 2013.

On January 14, 2013, William was hospitalized and eventually diagnosed with [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia), sub-typed [Philadelphia chromosome (9-22 translocation)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome).  This is a rare form of leukemia that is very difficult to treat and a <a href="http://www.supportwilliam.com/what-is-a-bone-marrow-transplant/" target="_blank">bone marrow transplant</a> is the primary treatment option.  William&#8217;s leukemia is in remission after a series of chemotherapy treatment at the <a href="http://uscnorriscancer.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, and his doctors are now searching the [bone marrow registries](http://www.supportwilliam.com/how-can-we-help/) for a potential donor for a bone marrow transplant to ensure William remain cancer-free.  Both his brothers, Vince and Marvin, <a href="http://marrow.org/Patient/Transplant_Process/Search_Process/HLA_Matching__Finding_the_Best_Donor_or_Cord_Blood_Unit.aspx#basics" target="_blank">are not matches</a>, so we need your help to grow these registries so that there is a better chance of finding matched donors for William and others who need bone marrow transplants!
