I want to thank all of you who have taken the time and effort to help me out in this difficult journey in any way that you can.  I’ve survived a rough ride so far, and I will continue to fight my way to a full recovery.  I believe your help and support will give me the strength to fight this battle successfully.  I hope you can help to spread the word to your circle of friends as well.  Every little bit helps!
